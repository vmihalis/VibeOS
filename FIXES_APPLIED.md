# VibeOS Boot Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate MOTD Display**
   - Removed MOTD display from `.bash_profile` since system already shows it
   - This prevents the welcome message from appearing multiple times

2. **vibesh Not Executable**
   - Added file permissions in `profiledef.sh` to make `/usr/local/bin/vibesh` executable (755)
   - Changed `.bash_profile` to use `python3` directly to run vibesh as fallback

3. **Python Module Structure**
   - Added `__init__.py` to source shell modules directory
   - Updated build script to ensure `__init__.py` is copied to the ISO

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added Python availability check before attempting to run vibesh
   - Added stderr redirection (2>&1) to see any Python errors
   - Added informative message "Starting VibeOS Natural Language Shell..."

## Files Modified

- `src/archiso/airootfs/root/.bash_profile` - Removed duplicate MOTD, better error handling
- `src/archiso/profiledef.sh` - Added executable permissions for vibesh files
- `src/vibeos/shell/__init__.py` - Created to ensure proper Python module structure
- `scripts/build-iso.sh` - Ensures __init__.py is created in the build

## To Test

1. Rebuild the ISO:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. Test in QEMU:
   ```bash
   make test
   # or
   ./test-vibeos.sh
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. Boot shows normal Arch Linux messages (including "Please configure your system")
2. Auto-login as root
3. Single VibeOS welcome message (no duplicates)
4. Message "Starting VibeOS Natural Language Shell..."
5. vibesh launches successfully with natural language prompt

## Notes

- The "Please configure your system" message is normal Arch Linux behavior
- It appears during the systemd first boot wizard process
- This doesn't affect functionality - it's just part of the boot sequence
